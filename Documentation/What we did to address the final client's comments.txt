Client Requests for final submission

- Main request is to revise the coherence between the documentation and the system

	José Alejandro Sarmiento updated the implementation model to include everything the project has right now. 
	
	The implementation model with absolutely all the classes divided by layers and the class diagram with only the entities 
	can be found on the Triis Spring Models Model as well as different sequence diagrams. 

	Our first design diagram and the first sequence diagrams we made can be found on the 02 Design.

	The different iterations of our first project (old attempt) can be found on 03.1 Implementation Model.
	
	Our Deployment Diagram can be found on 03.2 Deployment Model.

	The requirements, use cases and domain diagrams are all in their respective models inside 01 Analysis.


- Second request is to complete the code documentation with Javadoc comments including authorship. Please note that you can add multiple @author tags in a class 

	José Alejandro Sarmiento included the @author tag in all the javadoc comments the rest of the group had already written. Then we generated the javadoc. 
	However, it was impossible to generate it with the @author tag. Apparently it is discontinued. Ziri investigated if it was possible to do it in any way but
	he didn't find a way to do it.

- Now for documents we needed for the final submission:
	
	Ksenia redacted the List of Requirements.
	José Alejandro Sarmiento redacted the Test Cases Developed and Functionalities Developed.

- Some extra things we did:
	
	Ziri investigated different alternatives for deployment.
	Jose tried deploying but was unsuccessful doing so.
